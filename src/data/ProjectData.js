    title: "Parallel Floyd-Steinberg Dithering",
    description: "We explored multiple parallel frameworks for accelerating the Floyd-Steinberg dithering algorithm through CUDA, OpenMP, and OpenMPI, reaching a max speedup of around 3x on a processor with 8 cores. In our exploration, we profiled the significant bottlenecks that impacted our results and identified sources of error/success in each implementation.",
